BEHOLD MY FIRST OFFICIAL GITHUB PROJECT!
It's not the most extravagant but it's to help me get used to git,github, doing a project without having some tutorial etc. The purpose of this program provide calculator services to the user, esentially a digital Ti-84 with
hopefully a GUI. It is currently in development so please bear that in mind. This project serves more as an introductory for me to git, github and essential learning how to build something that actually works.

As of right now the current goal is to have it work via terminal. The user can enter in some expression (ex: 3 - 4 or 3 * 5 - (3 ^2)) and it will output the result. You will be able to continue using the calculator until you type 'exit' into the termianl leading
the programs termination. 

I will update this README when i ahve make progess so be sure to look here when you can!....or not its just a calculator project so...yea
