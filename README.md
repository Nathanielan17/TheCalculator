# TheCalculator

The first implementation of this program will be without a GUI. It will focus on doing calculator-like operations based on user input in the terminal and print back the result. After the completion of terminal-based calculator, the 2nd phase of implementation will be adding a GUI that looks like a calculator, and store values of the most previous answer.

The purpose of this project is to help me ease into using Python and using packages/libraries and getting used to syntax and github
