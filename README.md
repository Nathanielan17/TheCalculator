# TheCalculator

The first implementation of this program will be without a GUI. It will focus on doing calculator-like operations based on user input in the terminal and print back the result. After the completion of terminal-based calculator, the 2nd phase of implementation will be adding a GUI that looks like a calculator, and store values of the most previous answer.

The purpose of this project is to help me ease into using Python and using packages/libraries and getting used to syntax and github.

Key Note: Due to my limited knowledge of GitHub I accidentally pushed my code for this project into Master instead of the Main branch. I may or may not fix this as this project is just to gain familiarity.
