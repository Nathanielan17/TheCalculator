BEHOLD MY FIRST OFFICIAL GITHUB PROJECT!
The purpose of this project is to create a calculator application where a user inputs an expression into the GUI and it will calculate the result.
This program primarily uses a recursive algorithim to break down the expression and use PEMDAS to accurately calculate the result. The Tkinter framework was
used to create the calculator GUI.
